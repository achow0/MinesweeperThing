# Minesweeper Thing
To use this, put your minesweeper scores into each file corresponding to the difficulty that you did. I made a one-liner in Python that will read integer values(separated by newlines) from 3 separate files and outputted various stats to the stats.txt file. Run the updateStats.py file to update the stats.txt if you have made any changes to the other 3 text files. Requires Python 3.8+ because I used the recently added Walrus Operator.
